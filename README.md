# ðŸ’¤ My LazyVim Configuration

This is a personal LazyVim configuration for my daily development and note-taking.
Therefore, it might not fit your needs, especially including several plugins written in Vimscript.
The current target version is neovim v10.0.3 and LazyVim v12.39, which is published in Sep.2024.
Considering the fast development pace of LazyVim, it is very likely that this configuration doesn't work well on the current LazyVim version and I'll try to up-to-date the whole configuration in the near future.

The configuration's target language is as follows:

- C++
- Python (a little bit)
- Scheme
- markdown (for note-taking)
